TODO: For this home page I want to create a side bar 
TODO: This will contain the profile button, the search exercise button
? Maybe combine the search knights and applications page. use scrollable elements to avoid pages getting too long
? Remove the logout button, add it to a popup from clicking the user's name
? profile page will contain a logout button but the user's name is the quick logout option
? put leaderboard where login button is located
